# Strike-Zone

This project is from Codecademy. The objective is this project is to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify where the strike zone is located. The dataset I used consist of three MLB players: Aaron Judge, Jose Altuve and David Ortiz and each dataset has almost 3,000 rows and 82 columns. I didn't use all columns to model after my SVM, I only used "plate_x", "plate_z", "strike" and the target variable is "type" which tells you if the pitch was a strike, ball or neither. The highest accuracy rate that I know of was from the Aaron Judge dataset with a accuracy rate of 85%.
